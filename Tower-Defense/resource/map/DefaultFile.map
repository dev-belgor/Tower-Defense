Tower-Defense Map File:
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// This is a comment, it starts with //.
// Comments can only start at the beginning of a line.
//
// A map file alway starts with "Tower-Defense Map File:"!
//
// There are certain variables you can set in a map file, these are:
//
// Version
// Author
// Description
// Theme
// Size
//
// Don't set the same variable twice!
// Setting a variable has the form: <variable name>=<variable value>
// The equality simbol (=) follows right after the variable name and the
// variable value follows right after the equlity symbol (=), no spaces
// in between!, no "' etc.
// Everything after the equality symbol (=) until the new line is seen as the
// variable value!
//
// Additionally to the variables there are sections:
//
// Moveable
// Buildable
// Graphics
//
// Sections have this form:
//
// <Section name>:
// <Section content>
//
// For Moveable, Buildable & Graphics:
//
// These sections describe where buildings can be built, where one can move and
// which graphic is used for which tile.
// One tile is an integer number. Tiles in a row are seperated with comma ','
// and a new row is started with a semicolon ';'.
// WARNING: make sure the dimension matches the size!
//
// NOTE: these specifications may change in later versions.
